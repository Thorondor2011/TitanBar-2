V2
Went over entire code, line by line. Changed A LOT. :) 
Removed a lot of duplicate code. The plugin is now less than half the original size.
Many thanks to Bunny (AltWallet) for me letting use his code in my plug-in. Thank you!

NEW:
- All wallet items owned by character are displayed in wallet control.
  Heavily relied on code by Bunny (AltWallet). Used with permission.
  All text is taken from in-game. So no need for translations for wallet or 
  updates to plug-in when Turbine updates the game.
  
REMOVED:
- Removed ability to change background color for controls/TitanBar. 
  I found out that it wasn't working in V1 and nobody noticed.
  So I figured nobody used it and it was safe to remove.
  If anybody wants it, I can restore the option.
  
KNOWN ISSUES:
- Some tool-tip texts for wallet items are larger than it's windows.
